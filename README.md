Create a single page application using AngularJS which has following views/functionalities  
 
1. View 1 - A view to list all books, characters and houses in same ng-repeat. The data should be sorted in alphabetical order and one type of card(or <div>) like book should look different from <div> of character. Use custom directive to achieve this functionality 
2. View 2 - On clicking the div, a view containing the detail of that book/character/house should open containing all the information about it in details
3. In View 1, create filters like sort (alphabetically reverse or forward), filter by name of author etc. You can think of more filters.
